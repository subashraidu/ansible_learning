# Ansible Galaxy vs. Docker Hub

Feature	| Ansible Galaxy	| Docker Hub
Purpose:	Repository for Ansible roles & collections	| Repository for Docker images
Content:	Roles, collections, playbooks, plugins	| Container images, including OS, apps, services
Usage:	Install automation code (e.g., ansible-galaxy install)	| Pull container images (e.g., docker pull)
Versioning:	Supports version control for roles	| Supports image tagging and versioning
Source:	Community contributions & private content	|Official images + community contributions
Example:	ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx	| docker pull nginx:latest


#How It Works in Ansible Galaxy:
Find Roles/Collections: Search for reusable Ansible content (e.g., nginx, mysql, docker).
Install Content: Use ansible-galaxy install to download roles or collections into your environment.
Share Your Work: Publish your own roles/collections for others to use.

example: ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx

ls ~/.ansible/roles
list the contents of the roles directory inside the .ansible (all locally installed Ansible roles are stored here)
~: Refers to your home directory (e.g., /home/username or /Users/username).
.ansible/roles: This is the folder where Ansible stores locally installed roles (unless configured otherwise).
