YAML ((YAML Ain't Markup Language))

YAML is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for:
Configuration files (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible)
Data exchange between languages with different data structures
Automation scripts

Syntax:

1. Key-Value Pairs

name: John Doe
age: 30
is_student: false

2. Lists (Arrays)
fruits:
  - Apple
  - Banana
  - Cherry
  
3. Nested Data (Using Indentation)
Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs!). Nested data refers to data structures where one data element (like a list or a dictionary) is contained within another. In YAML, this often means dictionaries inside dictionaries or lists inside dictionaries, and vice versa.

person:
  name: Alice
  details:
    age: 25
    city: New York
	
4. Mixing Dictionaries and Lists
