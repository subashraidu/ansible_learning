YAML ((YAML Ain't Markup Language))

YAML is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for:
Configuration files (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible)
Data exchange between languages with different data structures
Automation scripts

Syntax:

1. Key-Value Pairs

name: John Doe
age: 30
is_student: false

2. Lists (Arrays)
fruits:
  - Apple
  - Banana
  - Cherry
  
3. Nested Data (Using Indentation)
Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs!). Nested data refers to data structures where one data element (like a list or a dictionary) is contained within another. In YAML, this often means dictionaries inside dictionaries or lists inside dictionaries, and vice versa.

person:
  name: Alice
  details:
    age: 25
    city: New York
	
4. Mixing Dictionaries and Lists

employees:
  - name: Bob
    role: Developer
  - name: Carol
    role: Designer	

In YAML, the three hyphens (---) at the beginning of a playbook or any YAML file are used to indicate the start of a new document. If youâ€™re working with multiple documents in one file (like combining different configurations), the --- separator becomes even more useful:

---
- name: First play
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug: msg="This is the first play."

---
- name: Second play
  hosts: db_servers
  tasks:
    - debug: msg="This is the second play."
